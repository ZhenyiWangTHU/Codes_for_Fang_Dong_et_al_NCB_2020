# Codes_for_Fang_Dong_et_al_NCB_2020

This repository provides the codes used to perform data anlsysis in our recently published article: 

F. Dong et al., Differentiation of transplanted haematopoietic stem cells tracked by single-cell transcriptomic analysis. Nat Cell Biol. 125, 1â€“10 (2020).

If you use the scripts, please cite the paper!
